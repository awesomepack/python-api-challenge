## Selecting random cities using citipy Library

### Ctipy Library

Citipy's .nearest_city() method takes the longitude and lattitude as arguements and returns a city object. From this city object we can call methods such as city_name to obtain the name of the nearest city to the geo-coordinates we input.

Note: It looks like the longitude and lattitude values are in the signed degrees format , where south latitudes and west longitudes are preceded with a (-) sign. [1]
* The range of longitudes is [-180 : 180]
* The range of lattitudes is [-90 : 90]
